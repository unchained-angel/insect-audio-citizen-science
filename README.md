# Insect Audio Citizen Science

## Project Purpose
This project aims to collect, tag, and make accessible audio recordings of insects for citizen science initiatives. By leveraging community contributions, we can build a comprehensive dataset for bioacoustic research, species identification, and environmental monitoring.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in insect bioacoustics! Here's how you can help:

1.  **Recordings:** Submit your own audio recordings of insects. Please ensure recordings are clear and ideally in `.wav` or `.flac` format.
2.  **Tagging:** Help us tag existing recordings with relevant metadata such as species (if known), location, date, time, and recording conditions.
3.  **Development:** Contribute to the project's codebase by improving scripts, developing new tools, or enhancing documentation.

Detailed contribution guidelines will be provided in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Example Recordings and Tags
(Examples will be added here once data is available.)
